# 🛡️ Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response (Splunk Enterprise Edition)

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my work on **Task 2: Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response** as part of my internship with **Future Interns**.  
The project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment using **Splunk Enterprise Edition**, focusing on real-time alert monitoring, threat detection, and incident handling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate real-world SOC workflows.
- Monitor system and network activity for suspicious behavior.
- Detect and investigate potential security incidents.
- Apply structured incident response methodologies.
- Prepare clear, actionable reports for stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk Enterprise Edition** (Search Processing Language, Dashboards, Alerting)
- Simulated SIEM setup with real-world log formats
- Threat Intelligence Feeds

---

## 📈 Key Activities
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Tracked and visualized live network/system activity through Splunk dashboards.
- **Threat Detection:** Identified brute-force attempts, malicious logins, and suspicious endpoint behaviors.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlated logs from different sources and leveraged threat intel for deeper investigation.
- **Incident Response:** Executed containment, eradication, and recovery strategies.
- **Reporting:** Documented technical findings and recommended security measures.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Effective **alert triage** and prioritization.
- Understanding common **adversary tactics and techniques**.
- Hands-on experience with **log analysis & forensic investigation**.
- Converting technical results into **clear communication** for SOC teams.
